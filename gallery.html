<h1>Adhar Project's Events and Gallery</h1>
<p>Adhar Project have been offering support to those suffering with mental health difficulties since 1989, and have 
  since repeatedly improved our services in order to stay up to date with what's going on and ensure our support is of the best
  quality.

</p>

<p>
  Please explore our gallery to see some of the different approaches Adhar have taken to tackling mental health difficulties 
  amongst different communities, understanding that every person is diffenent meaning multiple approaches will always be required.
</p>


<h1>The Angel and the Devil - by Maya24Film</h1>

<p>To try and raise more awareness for suicide prevention and mental health problems, particularly in the South Asian community, 
  Adhar Project hosted an event with <strong><a href="https://southasianhealthaction.org.uk/" target="_blank">South Asian Health Action</a>, <a href="http://maya24film.co.uk/" target="_blank">Maya 24 Film</a>, 
    <a href="https://punjab2000.com/" target="_blank">Punjab2000</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/pam_sidhu" target="_blank">Pam Sidhu</a></strong>.

  </div>

</div>

<p><strong>The Angel and the Devil</strong> is a powerful film which tells the story of <strong>Sandeep Singh</strong>, and her struggle with mental health and 
being a suicide survivor. The event took place to help raise awareness, and involved a mindfulness session and Q&A session to help support those who were watching
the online event.</p>

<h1>World Mental Health Day 2020 - Investment</h1>
<p>World Mental Health Day is an extremely important day, which can be used to raise awareness of the different issues that people 
  who are suffering have to deal with every day. This year, the theme of World Mental Health Day is <strong>investment</strong>.
</p>

<strong><p>Adhar Project are therefore campaigning for better investment and access for BAME mental health services</strong>.</p>

  </div>

</div>

<p>To help raise awareness for better investment into BAME mental services, Adhar Project, alongside 
  <strong><a href="https://southasianhealthaction.org.uk/" target="_blank">South Asian Health Action</a>, <a href="http://maya24film.co.uk/" target="_blank">Maya 24 Film</a>,</strong>
  and other organisations, are holding a live screening of <strong>'A Diary to my Son'</strong>, a short film made by Maya 24 Film.
</p>

<p>
<strong>'A Diary to my Son'</strong> is a powerful story which addresses the stigma of <strong>domestic abuse, mental health</strong> and <strong>suicide</strong>
within the BAME community, by telling the true story of a mother who lost her beloved due to suicide.

<h1>BBC News</h1>
<p>Due to the amount of work that Adhar Project perfomed over Mental Health Awareness Week 2020, and throughout the entire lockdown period due to COVID-19, Adhar was invited to have a news 
  segment on <strong>BBC News East Midlands</strong>.</p>
  <p>This demonstrated some of the online events that Adhar had been performing to ensure that we could continue to support people with their mental health through these struggling times. As can be viewed below, Adhar 
    held mindfuless sessions, yoga sessions and more through online services such as Zoom, whilst still supporting all of our existing clients.

<h1>Our Clients and Staff Interviews</h1>

<p>Over the years that Adhar Project has been supporting people for, we have taken part in many interviews that allow us to 
  further explain our services, and so that we can demonstrate our work to support those struggling with mental health difficulties.

</p>
<p>Below are a number of interviews with our staff or clients, describing our services and showing off the care that we have for our work.</p>

<h1>Sign Language</h1>

<p>At Adhar Project, we strongly believe that it is important for all members of every community, regardless of their background or any other factor, have 
  the same access to mental health services. Therefore, Adhar produced multiple videos that describe the services we provide in sign language.
 </p>
 <p>All parts of the videos can be found below, or on our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBrnFIz3v3ggWKHTBIUfpfQ?view_as=subscriber">YouTube</a> channel.</p>

<h1>Social Media Campaign - Valentines Day</h1>
<p>For one week over February in 2020, Adhar completed a successful social media campaign, that had the aim of spreading awareness of Adhar's values and services whilst
  encouraging people to look after and love each other. To achieve this, Adhar produced a high amount of content for this week long campaign, which were related to different events 
  that took place, statistics that are based upon mental health and to create a different meaning to valentines day - encouraging people to care and love everyone around them.

<h1>Mental Health Awareness Week 2020</h1>
<p>Mental Health Awareness week 2020 took place over lockdown, making it a very different mental healt awareness week that anyone 
  had ever experienced before. In an attempt to celebrate mental health awareness week, and ensure that Adhar were doing as much as possible 
  to better peoples mental health during these troubling times, we held multiple online events for people to join.

</p>

<p>Some examples of these events include a mindfuless session, community training for those suffering from domestic abuse, a domestic abuse programme for victims, 
  online yoga sessions and raising and support awareness for the Black Lives Matter Movement.

<h1>Publications - A Healthy Respect</h1>

<p>Leicester Clinical Commissioning Group, through its Equality Unit and Adhar Project, took responsibility to plan and deliver 
  an African Carribean Health Conference in June 2015. The conference took place to discuss how to enable change and improvement 
  in the health service for African Caribbean people living in Leicestershire.
</p>
<p>The result was this publication, which provides important information and recommendations that arose as a result of this conference.</p>

<h1>Early Intervention and Prevention</h1>
<p>Leicester has an extremely diverse, BAME community living within the city. </p>
<p>These brochures show some of the ways in which Adhar provides support for those struggling with their mental health across all of Leicester as a city, 
  focusing on the Asian community in the north of Leicester, the Asian community in the east and the African, Caribbean and dual heritage adult community.
