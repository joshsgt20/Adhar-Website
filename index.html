  <h1>Welcome to The Adhar Project
      <p>A Leicester based mental health charity for the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups.</p></h1>

  <p>Mental illness affects one in four people at any point in time and the impact touches every person in society.
    There is a wide spectrum of conditions, including anxiety, addiction, obsession, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder,
    personality disorder, phobia or an eating disorder.</p>
<p>
 Adhar Project is committed to helping people with these conditions as well as their families, carers and health professionals.
 We have 30 years of experience in helping Adults and Families live healthier, happier, and productive lives.</p>
