<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Adhar Project was established in 1989, with the goal of providing community support services 
  to people who are suffering from mental health difficulties. Adhar are Leicester based charity for 
  Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups, although not exclusively.
</p>

<p>Adhar's services are mostly focused on delivering early prevention and intervention work for each individual. We 
  aim to offer support to people who are suffering with their mental health, hoping to improve their management, self-confidence 
  and ensure that they receive everything that they are entitled to.
</p>

<p>We therefore offer a variety of services, such as the advocacy project, therapeutic activities, support groups, 1-2-1 support,
  volunteering opportunities, employment support, the domestic abuse project and more. 

</p>

<p>Adhar have not stopped supporting people, even during the COVID-19 lockdown, being able to support our clients through adapted 
  methods, using online systems such as zoom to host events and ensure all of our clients are still a focus.
</p>
