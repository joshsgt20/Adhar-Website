<h1>Adhar Project Services</h1>
<p>As a team Adhar Project are committed to supporting people with their mental health difficulties, by helping
    them to understand their individual problems and be able to offer support where needed.
</p>

<h1>Our Mission</h1>
<p>Adhar Project empowers people to manage their own mental health difficulties. We aim
    to achieve this by addressing all factors that are related to the issue and delivering these
services in a culturally relevant and personalised way.</p>


<h1>Our Work in 2020</h1>
<h2>COVID-19</h2>
<p>2020 has been a year that has effected everyone accross the country, and has therefore had a massive 
    impact on peoples mental health. Although we were unable to support people in person due to lockdown, 
    Adhar continued to support people on a daily basis over online services, whilst still providing 
    <strong>emotional support</strong> and <strong>counselling sessions</strong> to our clients, old and new.</p>
    <p>
    Zoom sessions, such as the <strong>'Mindfulness' sessions</strong> were hosted to help support those with mental health issues and find
    ways to help manage and calm their mind. We understood that in these times, it was more important than ever for people to know that someone 
    was there to help support them. 
</p>

<h2>Mental Health Awareness Week 2020</h2>
<p>Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, for Mental Health Awareness Week 2020, Adhar took to social media to spread awareness of the ongoing issues that 
    had got gotten far worse over lockdown. To help support people, multiple zoom sessions were held every week, hosting sessions such as <strong>meditation, 
    breathing techniques, yoga sessions</strong> and more.

<h2 id="DomesticProject">Domestic Abuse Programme</h2>
<p>We have new programmes and initatives that are aimed to address issues that are ongoing and new.
    For example, we have recently started a Domestic Abuse Programme, aimed to help support those who 
    are involved in abusive relationships and help them begin to recover from these problems. This programme 
    began during the <strong>COVID-19 Lockdown</strong>, due to the increase in the amount of reports of domestic 
    abuse in households accross the UK.

<h2 id="RecoveryProject">Recovery Project</h2>
<p>Adhar recognises that people who are struggling with their mental health problems have experienced many difficulities on
    their journey to recovery. This project therefore emphasises the process of learning, engaging, taking action and engaging with others.
    It is about having positive thinking and actions, and developing participants sense of self-value and empowerment.
</p>
<p>Some of the activities that are offered in this project are 1-2-1 sessions, training workshops and community visits. When the client has
    completed the programme, they will be discharged and referred to the 'Peer Support Network', which will provide self-help for continued support 
    during their recovery.
</p>
<p><strong>The Recorvery Project is broken down into four sub-sections;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1) Understanding your mental health</strong>
<br>Adhar empowers our clients to learn more about their own mental health problems, by exploring their thoughts and feelings, and 
addressing some of the potential side effects of medication. We aim to give clients a sense of optimism and self-worth.</p>

<p><strong>2) Taking care of you</strong>
    <br>The main focus of this project is to help improve each clients self-care, by encouraging them to take part in new things, looking 
into previous interests and doing meaningful activities. We have also developed workshops to aid clients with managing their wellbeing, to help 
them maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>

    <p><strong>3) Taking positive action</strong>
        <br>We help our clients to identify their goals in life and take positive action to achieve them, by completing small tasks to make it 
    more achievable from action plans that are regularly reviewed.</p>

        <p><strong>4) Meaningful contacts</strong>
            <br>To help the clients wellbeing, we aid them to build and maintain meaningful relationships with others, helping them to build their 
        peer support network.</p>
            
<p><strong>The service can be accessed through six steps;</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li><p><strong>Referral:</strong> The referral might come from a social worker, GP, psychiatrist or psychiatric nurse, signposting from
    another organisation or by self-referrel.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Intake Assessment:</strong> This will allow the client to explore and communicate their problems and see if this project is right for them,
    if not othe options will be explored.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Attending Training:</strong> This will have a strong focus on the client learning and engaging with the project and taking positive action to help themself.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Monitoring:</strong> We will monitor our clients to check their improvement, such as their self-confidence, concentration, positive thinking, management of their symptoms, their 
    engagement and how they access local community services.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Review:</strong> Once the project is complete, we work closely with the client to appraise all improvements made and explore any futher, unmet needs that they may have, and creating a 
    recovery plan to address these.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Exit:</strong> We support the client in developing their 'Peer Support Network' to help benefit them going forward, or see whether further support is needed for the client 
    from Adhar's sercices.</p></li>
