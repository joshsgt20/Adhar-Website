<h1>Adhar Project Services</h1>
<p>As a team Adhar Project are committed to supporting people with their mental health difficulties, by helping
    them to understand their individual problems and be able to offer support where needed.
</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Adhar Project empowers people to manage their own mental health difficulties. We aim
    to achieve this by addressing all factors that are related to the issue and delivering these
services in a culturally relevant and personalised way.</p>

<h1>Our Projects</h1>

<h2>Domestic Abuse Programme</h2>
<p>We have new programmes and initatives that are aimed to address issues that are ongoing and new.
    For example, we have recently started a Domestic Abuse Programme, aimed to help support those who 
    are involved in abusive relationships and help them begin to recover from these problems. This programme 
    began during the <strong>COVID-19 Lockdown</strong>, due to the increase in the amount of reports of domestic 
    abuse in households accross the UK.
</p>

<h2>COVID-19</h2>
<p>2020 has been a year that has effected everyone accross the country, and has therefore had a massive 
    impact on peoples mental health. Although we were unable to support people in person due to lockdown, 
    Adhar continued to support people on a daily basis over online services, whilst still providing 
    <strong>emotional support</strong> and <strong>counselling sessions</strong> to our clients, old and new.</p>
    <p>
    Zoom sessions, such as the <strong>'Mindfulness' sessions</strong> were hosted to help support those with mental health issues and find
    ways to help manage and calm their mind. We understood that in these times, it was more important than ever for people to know that someone 
    was there to help support them. 
</p>

<h2>Mental Health Awareness Week 2020</h2>
<p>Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, for Mental Health Awareness Week 2020, Adhar took to social media to spread awareness of the ongoing issues that 
    had got gotten far worse over lockdown. To help support people, multiple zoom sessions were held every week, hosting sessions such as <strong>meditation, 
    breathing techniques, yoga sessions</strong> and more.
